# PitchAgent Multi-Agent Backend Architecture Plan

## 1. System Overview

The PitchAgent multi-agent backend will be a Python-based system that coordinates multiple specialized agents to deliver personalized pitch experiences. The system will integrate with your existing frontend (Next.js/Papermark) and RAG pipeline, and will use OpenAI's API and LlamaIndex for various functionalities.

Here's a high-level overview of the architecture:

```mermaid

    Frontend[Frontend - Next.js/Papermark] <--> API[API Layer - FastAPI]
    API <--> Orchestrator[Orchestrator Agent]
    Orchestrator <--> RAG[Existing RAG Pipeline]
    Orchestrator <--> ConversationAgent[Conversation Agent]
    Orchestrator <--> PersonalizationAgent[Personalization Agent]
    Orchestrator <--> WebhookManager[Webhook Manager]
    WebhookManager <--> VoiceAPI[Elevenlabs/Tavus API]
    RAG <--> VectorDB[(Vector Database)]
    PersonalizationAgent <--> InvestorDB[(Investor Database)]
```

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Orchestrator Agent

The Orchestrator Agent will be the central coordinator of the multi-agent system, responsible for:

- Receiving and routing user queries
- Determining which specialized agent should handle each query
- Maintaining conversation context and state
- Coordinating responses between agents
- Managing the overall conversation flow

**Implementation Details:**
- Built using OpenAI's API with a system prompt that defines its role as coordinator
- Maintains a conversation memory to track context
- Uses a decision-making framework to route queries to appropriate agents

### 2.2 Conversation Agent

The Conversation Agent will handle direct interactions with investors, including:

- Answering questions about the pitch deck
- Providing detailed explanations of business aspects
- Handling follow-up questions
- Maintaining a natural, engaging conversation flow

**Implementation Details:**
- Leverages the existing RAG pipeline to retrieve relevant information from the pitch deck
- Uses OpenAI's API with appropriate prompting to generate conversational responses
- Maintains its own conversation memory for context
- Implements techniques to ensure responses align with the founder's messaging

### 2.3 Personalization Agent

The Personalization Agent will customize the pitch experience based on investor preferences:

- Storing and retrieving investor profiles
- Adjusting content emphasis based on investor interests
- Personalizing examples and analogies
- Adapting communication style to match investor preferences

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses a simple database to store investor profiles
- Implements basic web scraping for investor research (for MVP)
- Uses LlamaIndex to process and structure investor information
- Provides personalization parameters to other agents

### 2.4 Webhook Manager

The Webhook Manager will handle real-time communication with the frontend:

- Managing webhook connections
- Sending and receiving real-time updates
- Coordinating with voice/video APIs (Elevenlabs/Tavus)
- Handling state synchronization

**Implementation Details:**
- Implements webhook handlers using FastAPI
- Manages asynchronous communication
- Handles connection state and retries
- Provides a bridge between the multi-agent system and external APIs

**Mitigation**:
- Start with basic personalization parameters
- Implement feedback mechanisms to improve over time
- Use default strategies when specific data is unavailable


I'll expand on the personalization capabilities and how we'll gather and use investor information in the MVP. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

# Enhanced Personalization Capabilities for PitchAgent MVP

## 1. Investor Data Collection

### 1.1 Data Sources

For the MVP, we'll implement a tiered approach to investor data collection:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Investor Data Collection] --> B[Tier 1: Manual Input]
    A --> C[Tier 2: Basic Web Scraping]
    A --> D[Tier 3: Public APIs]
    
    B --> B1[Founder-provided information]
    B --> B2[Direct investor preferences]
    
    C --> C1[LinkedIn profiles]
    C --> C2[Company websites]
    C --> C3[Investment firm portfolios]
    
    D --> D1[Crunchbase API]
    D --> D2[PitchBook API - if available]
    D --> D3[News APIs]
```

#### Tier 1: Manual Input
- **Founder-provided information**: Allow founders to input what they know about investors
- **Direct investor preferences**: If available, use preferences directly specified by investors
- **Implementation**: Simple form interfaces and database storage

#### Tier 2: Basic Web Scraping
For the MVP, we'll implement lightweight scrapers for:
- **LinkedIn profiles**: Extract professional background, interests, and recent activity
- **Investment firm websites**: Gather investment thesis, portfolio companies, and focus areas
- **Portfolio analysis**: Identify patterns in previous investments

```python
# Example scraper implementation (simplified)
class LinkedInScraper:
    def __init__(self, proxy_config=None):
        self.session = self._create_session(proxy_config)
        
    def scrape_investor_profile(self, profile_url):
        """Scrape basic information from LinkedIn profile."""
        try:
            response = self.session.get(profile_url)
            soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
            
            data = {
                'name': self._extract_name(soup),
                'headline': self._extract_headline(soup),
                'about': self._extract_about(soup),
                'experience': self._extract_experience(soup),
                'education': self._extract_education(soup),
                'interests': self._extract_interests(soup),
                'recent_activity': self._extract_activity(soup)
            }
            
            return data
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error scraping LinkedIn profile: {e}")
            return None
```

#### Tier 3: Public APIs
If budget allows, integrate with:
- **Crunchbase API**: For comprehensive investment data
- **PitchBook API**: For detailed investor profiles (if available)
- **News APIs**: To gather recent mentions and activities

### 1.2 Data Processing Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Raw Data Collection] --> B[Data Cleaning]
    B --> C[Entity Resolution]
    C --> D[Feature Extraction]
    D --> E[Investor Profile Creation]
    E --> F[Vector Embedding]
    F --> G[Storage in Database]
```

1. **Data Cleaning**: Normalize formats, remove duplicates, handle missing values
2. **Entity Resolution**: Match data from different sources to the same investor
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant attributes for personalization
4. **Investor Profile Creation**: Create structured profiles
5. **Vector Embedding**: Generate embeddings for semantic matching
6. **Storage**: Store in both structured database and vector database

## 2. Investor Profile Schema

For the MVP, we'll implement a comprehensive investor profile schema:

```python
class InvestorProfile:
    def __init__(self):
        # Basic information
        self.id = None
        self.name = None
        self.firm = None
        self.position = None
        self.contact_info = {}
        
        # Investment preferences
        self.investment_stages = []  # seed, series A, etc.
        self.investment_sizes = []   # ranges
        self.sectors = []            # fintech, healthtech, etc.
        self.geographies = []        # regions of interest
        
        # Previous investments
        self.portfolio = []          # companies invested in
        self.successful_exits = []   # successful portfolio companies
        
        # Communication preferences
        self.communication_style = None  # formal, casual, technical
        self.detail_level = None         # high-level, detailed
        self.known_interests = []        # personal/professional interests
        
        # Derived attributes (calculated)
        self.risk_profile = None         # conservative, moderate, aggressive
        self.decision_factors = {}       # weighted importance of different factors
        self.personality_traits = {}     # derived personality characteristics
        
        # Metadata
        self.data_sources = []           # sources of this information
        self.confidence_scores = {}      # confidence in different attributes
        self.last_updated = None         # timestamp
```

## 3. Personalization Engine

### 3.1 Personalization Parameters

The MVP will focus on these key personalization dimensions:

1. **Content Emphasis**
   - Which aspects of the pitch to emphasize (product, market, team, financials)
   - Based on investor's previous investments and stated preferences
   
2. **Communication Style**
   - Formal vs. casual
   - Technical vs. non-technical
   - Direct vs. storytelling approach
   
3. **Detail Level**
   - High-level overview vs. detailed explanations
   - Data-driven vs. vision-driven
   
4. **Pace and Structure**
   - Quick highlights vs. comprehensive walkthrough
   - Linear vs. non-linear presentation
   
5. **Examples and Analogies**
   - Industry-specific examples
   - References to portfolio companies
   - Analogies based on known interests

### 3.2 Personalization Agent Implementation

The Personalization Agent will use a combination of rule-based and ML-based approaches:

```python
class PersonalizationAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)
        self.investor_db = InvestorDatabase()
        self.llm_service = LLMService()
        self.scraper_service = ScraperService()
        
    async def get_investor_profile(self, investor_id):
        """Retrieve or create investor profile."""
        profile = await self.investor_db.get_profile(investor_id)
        
        if not profile or profile.needs_update():
            # Gather new information
            await self.update_investor_profile(investor_id)
            profile = await self.investor_db.get_profile(investor_id)
            
        return profile
    
    async def update_investor_profile(self, investor_id):
        """Update investor profile with latest information."""
        basic_info = await self.investor_db.get_basic_info(investor_id)
        
        # Tier 1: Use existing information
        
        # Tier 2: Web scraping if we have URLs
        if basic_info.linkedin_url:
            linkedin_data = await self.scraper_service.scrape_linkedin(
                basic_info.linkedin_url
            )
            await self.investor_db.update_from_linkedin(investor_id, linkedin_data)
            
        if basic_info.firm_website:
            firm_data = await self.scraper_service.scrape_firm_website(
                basic_info.firm_website
            )
            await self.investor_db.update_from_firm_data(investor_id, firm_data)
        
        # Tier 3: API calls if available
        if self.config.use_crunchbase_api and basic_info.crunchbase_id:
            crunchbase_data = await self.scraper_service.get_crunchbase_data(
                basic_info.crunchbase_id
            )
            await self.investor_db.update_from_crunchbase(investor_id, crunchbase_data)
    
    async def generate_personalization_params(self, investor_id, pitch_id):
        """Generate personalization parameters for a specific pitch."""
        investor = await self.get_investor_profile(investor_id)
        pitch = await self.pitch_db.get_pitch(pitch_id)
        
        # Rule-based personalization
        params = self._apply_basic_rules(investor, pitch)
        
        # LLM-enhanced personalization
        enhanced_params = await self._enhance_with_llm(investor, pitch, params)
        
        return enhanced_params
    
    def _apply_basic_rules(self, investor, pitch):
        """Apply basic rule-based personalization."""
        params = PersonalizationParams()
        
        # Set content emphasis based on investor sectors
        params.content_emphasis = self._determine_content_emphasis(
            investor.sectors, 
            investor.decision_factors
        )
        
        # Set communication style
        params.communication_style = investor.communication_style or "balanced"
        
        # Set detail level based on position and previous preferences
        params.detail_level = self._determine_detail_level(
            investor.position,
            investor.detail_level
        )
        
        # Set pace based on derived personality traits
        params.pace = investor.personality_traits.get("patience", "moderate")
        
        return params
    
    async def _enhance_with_llm(self, investor, pitch, base_params):
        """Enhance personalization using LLM."""
        # Prepare context for LLM
        context = self._prepare_llm_context(investor, pitch, base_params)
        
        # Generate enhanced personalization
        response = await self.llm_service.complete(
            prompt=PERSONALIZATION_PROMPT,
            context=context
        )
        
        # Parse and validate LLM suggestions
        enhanced_params = self._parse_llm_suggestions(response, base_params)
        
        return enhanced_params
    
    async def personalize_response(self, response, personalization_params):
        """Apply personalization to a response."""
        # Apply personalization transformations
        personalized = await self.llm_service.complete(
            prompt=PERSONALIZE_RESPONSE_PROMPT,
            context={
                "original_response": response,
                "params": personalization_params
            }
        )
        
        return personalized
```

### 3.3 Example Personalization Prompt

```
You are personalizing a pitch response for an investor. 
Apply the following personalization parameters to transform the original response:

Content Emphasis: {params.content_emphasis}
Communication Style: {params.communication_style}
Detail Level: {params.detail_level}
Pace: {params.pace}

The investor has previously invested in: {investor.portfolio}
The investor's known interests include: {investor.known_interests}

Original response:
{original_response}

Provide a personalized version that:
1. Emphasizes the aspects most relevant to this investor
2. Uses the appropriate communication style
3. Provides the right level of detail
4. Maintains the core information while adjusting presentation
5. References relevant examples from their portfolio when appropriate

Personalized response:
```

### 4.2 MVP Limitations and Future Enhancements

For transparency, the MVP will have these limitations:

1. **Data Freshness**: Initial profiles may contain outdated information
2. **Coverage**: Not all investors will have comprehensive profiles
3. **Personalization Depth**: Initial personalization will focus on broader categories
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Limited ability to assess confidence in derived attributes

Future enhancements beyond MVP:
1. **Continuous Learning**: Improve personalization based on interaction feedback
2. **Advanced NLP**: More sophisticated analysis of investor communications
3. **Expanded Data Sources**: Integration with more specialized databases
4. **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommendations based on similar investors
5. **Multi-modal Personalization**: Extend to visual and interactive elements

### 4.3 Measuring Personalization Effectiveness

To evaluate the effectiveness of personalization:

1. **A/B Testing**: Compare personalized vs. non-personalized responses
2. **Engagement Metrics**: Track investor interaction patterns
3. **Feedback Collection**: Gather explicit feedback from founders and investors
4. **Conversion Tracking**: Monitor progression from pitch to follow-up meetings

## 5. Example Investor Research Flow

Here's how the system would research an investor in practice:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant F as Founder
    participant S as System
    participant DB as Database
    participant W as Web Scrapers
    participant API as External APIs
    participant LLM as LLM Service
    
    F->>S: Adds investor "Jane Smith from Acme Ventures"
    S->>DB: Check if profile exists
    DB-->>S: No existing profile
    S->>F: Request basic information
    F->>S: Provides LinkedIn URL and email
    
    S->>W: Scrape LinkedIn profile
    W-->>S: Return professional background
    S->>W: Scrape Acme Ventures website
    W-->>S: Return firm investment thesis
    
    S->>API: Query Crunchbase for portfolio
    API-->>S: Return investment history
    
    S->>LLM: Generate initial investor profile
    LLM-->>S: Return structured profile
    S->>DB: Store investor profile
    
    S->>LLM: Generate personalization strategy
    LLM-->>S: Return personalization parameters
    S->>DB: Store personalization strategy
    
    S-->>F: Confirm investor profile created
```

## 6. Integration with Orchestrator and Conversation Agents

The Personalization Agent will integrate with other agents as follows:

### 6.1 Orchestrator Integration

```python
# In orchestrator.py
async def handle_query(self, query, conversation_id):
    """Handle incoming query from investor."""
    # Get conversation context
    conversation = await self.conversation_db.get_conversation(conversation_id)
    investor_id = conversation.investor_id
    pitch_id = conversation.pitch_id
    
    # Get personalization parameters
    personalization_params = await self.personalization_agent.generate_personalization_params(
        investor_id, pitch_id
    )
    
    # Route to appropriate agent

## Market Positioning and Differentiation

Based on the competitive landscape, here's how PitchAgent appears to be uniquely positioned:

### Key Differentiators for PitchAgent

1. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Unlike most solutions that use a single AI model, PitchAgent's multi-agent approach allows for specialized handling of different aspects of the pitch process.

2. **Interactive Voice Experience**: While many platforms offer document sharing or pre-recorded videos, PitchAgent provides a real-time interactive voice experience.

3. **Investor-Specific Personalization**: PitchAgent's focus on researching and adapting to specific investors goes beyond the general templates offered by most pitch platforms.

4. **Founder-Led Customization**: The ability for founders to shape the personality, tone, and emphasis of their PitchAgent creates a more authentic experience than generic AI solutions.

5. **Conversation Intelligence**: The ability to handle questions, expand on topics, and adapt in real-time sets PitchAgent apart from static pitch solutions.

### Potential Partnership Opportunities

Based on the landscape, these companies could be potential partners rather than competitors:

1. **Papermark**: Already mentioned as your frontend, could provide document sharing and analytics.

2. **Tavus/ElevenLabs**: For voice and video capabilities.

3. **Crunchbase/Grata**: For investor data enrichment.

4. **DocSend/Visible**: For post-pitch follow-up and relationship management.

### Market Gaps PitchAgent Addresses

1. **Scaling Founder Time**: No existing solution effectively allows founders to be in multiple places at once for pitching.

2. **Personalization at Scale**: Current solutions don't offer deep personalization for each investor.

3. **Interactive Non-Live Pitching**: Most solutions are either static (documents) or require live presence (video calls).

4. **Founder Authenticity in Automation**: Maintaining the founder's voice and priorities in an automated system.

## Conclusion

The competitive landscape reveals that while there are many solutions addressing parts of the fundraising and pitch process, none offer the comprehensive, interactive, personalized approach that PitchAgent aims to provide. The multi-agent architecture combined with voice capabilities and investor-specific personalization represents a novel approach in this market.

The closest competitors are either focused on pitch deck creation and optimization (Pitch.ai, Slidebean) or on investor research and matching (Affinity, Grata), but none combine these with an interactive AI-powered pitch delivery system.

This suggests that PitchAgent has identified a genuine gap in the market, with the potential to create significant value for founders by allowing them to effectively scale their fundraising efforts without sacrificing personalization or quality.

## Relevance to PitchAgent

When developing PitchAgent's multi-agent backend, these existing solutions offer several insights:

### Investor Research Integration

1. **Data Sources**: Companies like Crunchbase, PitchBook, and CB Insights demonstrate the value of comprehensive investor data. PitchAgent could integrate with these platforms' APIs or develop similar data collection mechanisms.

2. **Personalization Factors**: Solutions like Signal by NFX show what factors are most relevant for matching founders with investors (sector focus, stage preferences, investment history). These can inform PitchAgent's personalization parameters.

3. **Relationship Intelligence**: Affinity's approach to relationship mapping could inspire how PitchAgent tracks and leverages existing connections between founders and investors.

### Pitch Training Insights

1. **Common Feedback Areas**: PitchBot.ai and Pitch Genius highlight the aspects of pitches that typically need improvement (pacing, clarity, structure, storytelling). PitchAgent can incorporate these insights into its conversation agent.

2. **Question Preparation**: Several platforms focus on preparing founders for investor questions. PitchAgent could build a comprehensive database of typical investor questions and optimal responses.

3. **Delivery Customization**: The emphasis on delivery style in solutions like PitchBot.ai suggests that PitchAgent should allow founders to customize not just content but also delivery parameters (pace, formality, detail level).

### Differentiation Opportunities

1. **Real-time Adaptation**: Unlike most existing solutions that provide static analysis or pre-recorded practice, PitchAgent can offer real-time adaptation during investor interactions.

2. **Multi-agent Specialization**: PitchAgent's multi-agent approach could provide more specialized expertise than the general-purpose AI in existing solutions.

3. **Scalable Personalization**: While current solutions help founders prepare personalized pitches, PitchAgent can deliver personalized experiences to multiple investors simultaneously.

4. **Continuous Learning**: PitchAgent could implement feedback loops that improve personalization over time based on investor engagement and responses.

By understanding these existing solutions, PitchAgent can incorporate their best features while addressing their limitations through its innovative multi-agent architecture and real-time personalization capabilities.
